  ## Description 

  I built this app to improve upon my sql knowledge as well as learn how handlebar works. The app itself is very simple, when the user opens the link they are presented with the following screen.

  Once the create a burger field is filled out, the user is presented with the burger that they named and a button to eat it. If the devour button is selected, the burger is then moved into the eaten section.
